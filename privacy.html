    <p>Welcome to EpicRush. Your privacy is a top priority for us. We are committed to being transparent about how we collect, use, and protect your information. This policy is written in plain language to help you understand our practices. Our goal is to collect only the data necessary to provide and improve our multiplayer games and community features, giving you full control over your information.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>To run our services, we collect a minimal amount of information. Here’s what we collect and why:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account Information (Optional):</strong> If you create an account, we may collect a username, email address, and password. We use this to save your progress, manage your friend list, and secure your account. You are not required to create an account to play many of our games.</li>
      <li><strong>Gameplay Data:</strong> We automatically collect data about your in-game activity, such as your scores, achievements, game session length, and interactions with other players in a game. This helps us balance games, fix bugs, and power features like leaderboards.</li>
      <li><strong>User-Generated Content:</strong> We collect information you voluntarily provide, such as messages in game chat, forum posts, or your public profile information. Please be mindful not to share personal information in public-facing community spaces.</li>
      <li><strong>Contact Information:</strong> If you contact us directly via our contact form or email, we will have a record of our correspondence, including your name and email address, to provide you with support.</li>
      <li><strong>Technical & Usage Data:</strong> We collect anonymous or aggregated data about how you interact with our website, such as your browser type, device type, pages visited, and time spent on the site. We use this information to understand traffic, improve site performance, and ensure compatibility. This is collected via standard server logs and minimal, privacy-focused analytics.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Our primary goal is to provide a fun and safe gaming environment. We use your information to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Operate and maintain our games and website.</li>
      <li>Enable multiplayer functionality, such as creating private rooms and connecting with friends.</li>
      <li>Display leaderboards and personal high scores.</li>
      <li>Personalize your experience (e.g., by showing your username).</li>
      <li>Communicate with you for support or to respond to feedback.</li>
      <li>Monitor and analyze usage to improve our services and develop new games.</li>
      <li>Enforce our Terms of Service and Community Guidelines to ensure a fair and respectful environment for all players.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not sell your personal information.</strong> We only share data in the following limited circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We may share information if you give us explicit permission to do so.</li>
      <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose your information if required by law or in response to a valid legal request.</li>
      <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may use third-party companies for services like website hosting or analytics. These providers only have access to the information necessary to perform their functions and are contractually obligated to protect it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>You have control over your personal information. You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access and Update:</strong> You can access and update your account information through your profile settings (if applicable).</li>
      <li><strong>Data Deletion:</strong> You can request the deletion of your account and associated personal data by contacting us.</li>
      <li><strong>Clear Local Data:</strong> You can clear locally stored data, such as high scores saved in your browser, by clearing your browser's cache and storage for our site.</li>
      <li><strong>Opt-Out of Communications:</strong> You can unsubscribe from any promotional emails we might send in the future.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no internet-based service is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our services are not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we learn that we have, we will take steps to delete such information promptly.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please don't hesitate to contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@epicrush.com">privacy@epicrush.com</a>. We're here to help.</p>
